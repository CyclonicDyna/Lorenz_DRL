## Suppressing chaos by intermittent chaos enhancing

This interactive webpage allows you to control the Lorenz 63 chaotic system by intermittently enhancing the level of chaos, a counter-intuitive approach. 

There are two modes available: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) Control Mode and Manual Control Mode. You can switch between the modes using the switcher located in the bottom right corner of the webpage.
### a) DRL Control Mode
In DRL control mode, the Lorenz system is controlled by a neural network trained with deep reinforcement learning. This provides an automated approach to controlling the chaotic system. 
### b) Manual Control Mode
In manual control mode, you can take control of the Lorenz system yourself. To temporarily increase the chaoticity of the Lorenz system (ρ = 28.0 -> ρ = 29.0), press the "Shift" key. Note that there is a minor difference from the paper: the perturbation of ρ is from 28 to 29, rather than from 28 to 28.28. This change was made to make manual control easier.
