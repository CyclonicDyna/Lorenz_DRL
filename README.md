This [webpage](https://prediction.riken.jp/lorenz63/LorenzControl29.html) serves as a supplementary material for our recently submitted paper, "Chaos Suppression through Chaos Enhancement." The aim of this webpage is to demonstrate the suppression of chaos in the Lorenz system by intermittent chaos enhancement – a counter-intuitive task with many real-world applications.

You have the option to suppress chaos either manually by applying perturbations to the system or automatically using a pre-trained neural network. In Manual mode, you can apply perturbations to the system (i.e., temporarily increase the value of ρ) by pressing the Shift key. In the DRL Control mode, a pre-trained neural network governs the perturbation to the Lorenz system. You can observe how the neural network achieves control and then attempt to apply this knowledge in Manual mode. Once mastered, you'll find the control surprisingly simple (yet the underlying principle remains interesting).

Additional information and the underlying principles will be available upon publication of our paper. Finally, we’d like to note a minor deviation from the paper's content: the perturbation of ρ has been adjusted to 28 → 29 (instead of 28 → 28.28), in order to facilitate easier manual control.
